# Browser E2E tests

Standalone Playwright tests that drive the real SPA in headless Chrome. Isolated
from the app's dependencies (own `package.json`) and uses the **system Chrome**
(`channel: 'chrome'`), so no browser binaries are downloaded.

## Prerequisites

- The local dev stack running (client on `:3001`, API on `:8001`).
- Google Chrome installed on the host.
- Node 18+ (for global `fetch`).

## Install (once)

```bash
cd tests/e2e
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
```

## Authenticate

The tests skip the login form by injecting a Sanctum token into `localStorage`.
Mint one for a superadmin from the backend container:

```bash
docker exec citizenone-backend php artisan tinker --execute='
  $u = App\Models\User::where("email","superadmin@test.com")->first();
  echo $u->createToken("e2e")->plainTextToken;
'
```

## Run

```bash
cd tests/e2e
CO_TOKEN='<paste-token>' npm run test:email-templates
```

Optional env: `CO_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:3001`),
`CO_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:8001`).

Screenshots are written to `tests/e2e/screenshots/`. The email-templates test is
self-restoring (the one template it edits is reset via the API at the end).

### `create-report-permission` — also needs a restricted staff token

Covers AW-2026-4255: a staff member without save-and-download rights must
still be able to create a report. Besides `CO_TOKEN` (Admin, used for API
setup/teardown) and `CO_CITIZEN_UUID`, this test needs `CO_STAFF_TOKEN`: a
token for a `User`-role staff member in the same company who has
`create_citizen_document`/`create_citizen_plan` but explicitly **not**
`save_and_download_citizen_document`/`save_and_download_citizen_plan` (the
Birketoften ApS shape from the ticket). Mint it the same way as the superadmin
token above:

```bash
php artisan tinker --execute='
  $admin = App\Models\User::where("email","superadmin@test.com")->first();
  $u = App\Models\User::firstOrCreate(
    ["email" => "e2e-staff@test.com"],
    ["firstname" => "E2E", "lastname" => "Staff", "phone" => "+4500000099",
     "company_id" => $admin->company_id, "language_id" => $admin->language_id,
     "password" => bcrypt("password"), "is_bot" => false, "is_archived" => false]
  );
  if (! $u->hasRole("User")) $u->assignRole("User");
  $u->syncPermissions(["create_citizen_document", "create_citizen_plan"]);
  echo $u->createToken("e2e-staff")->plainTextToken;
'
```

```bash
CO_TOKEN='<admin-token>' CO_STAFF_TOKEN='<staff-token>' CO_CITIZEN_UUID='<uuid>' \
  npm run test:create-report-permission
```
